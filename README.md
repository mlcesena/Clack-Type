# Clack Type

Clack type is a minimal typing test built completely using React. My goal with this project was to dive deeper into React and its capabilities. I wanted to challenge myself with a variety of new concepts.

## NOTE

This project was heavily inspired by the amazing work of the team at monkeytype.com! I love what they have produced and wanted to try out making my own version of a typing test.
